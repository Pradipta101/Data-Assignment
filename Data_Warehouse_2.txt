Design a Data Warehouse for Food delivery app like Swiggy, Zomato (Asked in Grab for Data Engineer role)

      Note : While designing any Data Warehouse make sure to cover given below points.
      a. Design Fact & Dimension tables
      b. Create meaningful Primary & Foreign keys
      c. Try to follow Star/SnowFlake Schema Design
      d. Try to write few SQL queries to generate insightful business metrics (This is the critical
      point because you need to understand the Data & Business both)



Design Fact & Dimension tables:

Fact Table: Order_Fact
Order_ID (Primary Key)
Customer_ID (Foreign Key from Customer Dimension)
Restaurant_ID (Foreign Key from Restaurant Dimension)
Order_Date (Foreign Key from Date Dimension)
Order_Time (Foreign Key from Time Dimension)
Total_Amount

Dimension Table: Customer
Customer_ID (Primary Key)
Customer_Name
Email_ID
Phone_Number
Address
City

Dimension Table: Restaurant
Restaurant_ID (Primary Key)
Restaurant_Name
Cuisine_Type
City

Dimension Table: Date
Date_ID (Primary Key)
Order_Date
Day_of_Week
Month
Year

Dimension Table: Time
Time_ID (Primary Key)
Order_Time
Hour

b. Create meaningful Primary & Foreign keys:

Order_ID will be the Primary Key for the Order_Fact table.
Customer_ID will be the Primary Key for the Customer Dimension table and Foreign Key for the Order_Fact table.
Restaurant_ID will be the Primary Key for the Restaurant Dimension table and Foreign Key for the Order_Fact table.
Date_ID will be the Primary Key for the Date Dimension table and Foreign Key for the Order_Fact table.
Time_ID will be the Primary Key for the Time Dimension table and Foreign Key for the Order_Fact table.


c. Try to follow Star/SnowFlake Schema Design:
The above design follows Star Schema Design as it has a central fact table (Order_Fact) and multiple dimension tables (Customer, Restaurant, Date, Time) surrounding it.


d. Try to write few SQL queries to generate insightful business metrics:

1. Total Order Count by City:

SELECT City, COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM Order_Fact
JOIN Restaurant ON Order_Fact.Restaurant_ID = Restaurant.Restaurant_ID
GROUP BY City

2. Average Order Amount by City:

SELECT City, AVG(Total_Amount) AS Average_Order_Amount
FROM Order_Fact
JOIN Restaurant ON Order_Fact.Restaurant_ID = Restaurant.Restaurant_ID
GROUP BY City

3. Total Order Count by Cuisine Type:

SELECT Cuisine_Type, COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM Order_Fact
JOIN Restaurant ON Order_Fact.Restaurant_ID = Restaurant.Restaurant_ID
GROUP BY Cuisine_Type

4. Total Order Count by Day of Week:

SELECT Day_of_Week, COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM Order_Fact
JOIN Date ON Order_Fact.Date_ID = Date.Date_ID
GROUP BY Day_of_Week

5. Total Order Count by Hour:

SELECT Hour, COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Orders
FROM Order_Fact
JOIN Time ON Order_Fact.Time_ID = Time.Time_ID
GROUP BY Hour
